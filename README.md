pull requests are accepted.

Launcher is currently work in progress, not ready to launch the game just yet.

## Running and building the launcher
1: Install rust (requires visual studio on windows which is the current one the launcher support at the mmoment)
2: Install Yarn `npm i -g yarn`
3: yarn dev tauri
